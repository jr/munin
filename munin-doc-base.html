<h2>Background</h2>
Munin is a server/node pair that graph, htmlifies and optionaly
warns nagios about data it gathers. It's designed to let it be very easy to
graph new datasources.

<h2>The Node</h2>

<h3>munin-node</h3>
Munin-node is a small perlscript listening to port 4949 using
Net::Server. It reads all the scripts in /etc/munin/plugins on
startup. The node accepts these commands:
<tt>
<dl>
 <dt>list [node]<dd>list available scripts for this node
 <dt>nodes<dd>List availbale nodes
 <dt>config [script]<dd>output configuration for [script]
 <dt>fetch [script]<dd>output script values
 <dt>version<dd>Output version string
 <dt>quit<dd>disconnect
</dl>
</tt>

<h3>Scripts</h3>
These scripts can be in your language of choice: bash, perl, python, C,
or anything else that your system can execute. The scripts can be run in
several modes, the important ones being without parameters, and with the
"config"-parameter. When run with "config" as parameter, the script
should output the configuration of the graph. 
<pre>
jo@yes:~$ munin-run load config
graph_title Load average
graph_args --base 1000 -l 0
graph_vlabel load
graph_scale no
load.label load
load.warning 10
load.critical 120
</pre>
The node supports quite a few options.
<tt>
<dl>
<dt>graph_title<dd>The title of the graph, defaults to the servicename.
<dt>create_args<dd>If set, the arguments will be passed on to rrdcreate.
<dt>graph_args<dd>If set, the arguments will be passed on to rrdgraph.
<dt>graph_order<dd>In witch order to draw the datasources. Can also include path aliases on the form alias=domain;host:graph.datasource. See further down for details.
<dt>graph_vlabel<dd>Y-axis label of the graph. 
<dt>graph_vtitle<dd>Y-axis label of the graph. NOTE: Deprecated, use graph_vlabel.
<dt>graph_total<dd>If set, summarise all the datasources' values and use the value of graph_total as a label.
<dt>graph_scale<dd>Default on. If set, disables scaling of min/max/cur values.
<dt>graph<dd>Set to "yes" or "no". Decides wether to draw the graph. Defaults to "yes".
<dt>update<dd>Set to "yes" or "no". Decides wether munin-update should fetch data for the graph. Defaults to "yes".
<dt>host_name<dd>Override which host name this plugin is run for. Ugly -
see further down on how to do this in the node configuration files
instead, which is more elegant.
<dt>{name}.label<dd>REQUIRED. Name of the datasource. You can have many
datasouces in one graph.
<dt>{name}.cdef<dd>RPN-expression. Modify the values before graphing. See the FAQ for examples.
<dt>{name}.draw<dd>What to draw from the data source: AREA, LINE1-3. Defaults to LINE2.
<dt>{name}.graph<dd>Set to "no" or "yes. Decides wether to graph the data source. Defaults to yes.
<dt>{name}.max<dd>Maximum value. If the fetched value is below "max", it will be discarded.
<dt>{name}.min<dd>Minimum value. If the fetched value is below "min", it will be discarded.
<dt>{name}.negative<dd>Name of field to 'mirror' on the opposite side of zero. See the FAQ for examples.
<dt>{name}.skipdraw<dd>Disables drawing of datasource. NOTE: Deprecated - use {name}.graph instead.
<dt>{name}.type<dd>Type of datasource, COUNTER, ABSOLUTE, DERIVE and
GAUGE, defaults to GAUGE. Read "man rrdcreate" for more info. 
<dt>{name}.warning<dd>Used by munin-nagios. Can be a max value or a range
sepereated by colon. E.g. "min:", ":max", "min:max", "max".
<dt>{name}.critical<dd>Same as above.
</dl>
</tt>
{name} is limited to 19 characters, and the characters [a-zA-Z0-9_].<br>
<p>
Without options the script should only give out {name}.value
(value):
<pre>
jo@yes:~$ munin-run load
load.value 0.41
</pre>
<p>
All scriptnames containing other characters than alphanumerics, "-",
"_", and ".",  or starting with "." will be skipped. 
</p>
<p>
To run a plugin as a specific user and/or group, create a file in the
plugin configuration. This file is parsed as munin-node starts up.  It
can contain the following options:
<dl>
 <dt>[&lt;plugin-name&gt;]<dd>The following lines are for
 <code>plugin-name</code>.
 <dt>user &lt;username|userid&gt;<dd>Run plugin as this user
 <dt>group &lt;groupname|groupid&gt;[, &lt;groupname|groupid&gt;] [...]<dd>Run plugin as this group. If group is inside paranthesis, don't croak if it's nonexistant.
 <dt>command &lt;command&gt;<dd>Run command instad of plugin. "%c" will
 be expanded to what would otherwise have been run. E.g. "<code>command sudo
 -u root %c</code>".
 <dt>env.&lt;var&gt; &lt;contents&gt;<dd>Will cause the environment
 variable "<code>var</code> to be set to "<code>contents</code>" when
 running the plugin.
</dl>
Example:
<pre>
[exim_mailstats]
group mail

[cps_*]
user root

# Will cause the variable "mysqlopts" to be set...
[mysql_*]
env.mysqlopts --user foo --password fii
</pre>
</p>

<h3>File locations</h3>
According to <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">FHS</a>, this is
where you should place the files.
<h4>System package (Debian, RedHat, maybe others)</h4>
<dl>
 <dt>CONFDIR<dd>/etc/munin/
 <dt>SBINDIR<dd>/usr/sbin/
 <dt>LIBDIR<dd>/usr/share/munin/
 <dt>STATEDIR<dd>/var/run/munin/

</dl>


<h2>The Server</h2>
The server runs a cronjob as the user munin every 5 minutes. The cronjob
runs munin-update,munin-nagios,munin-graph and munin-html one by one. All
scripts creates a lockfile in @@STATEDIR@@. 

Everytime a script starts, it checks if the pid in the lockfile is alive
before starting.

<h3>/etc/munin/munin.conf</h3>
This is the configuration-file for all serverscripts.

<pre>
#Configfile for munin-server
dbdir       /var/lib/munin/
htmldir     /var/www/munin/
logdir      /var/log/munin
rundir      /var/run/munin/

#To warn Nagios
#nsca           /usr/bin/send_nsca
#nsca_config    /etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfg
#nsca_server    nagios.server.org

#
# Edit and uncomment the following to start surveilance
#
#[machine.testdomain.org]
#  address localhost

</pre>

Explaination:

<tt>
<dl>
 <dt>dbdir<dd>Rootdir for alle rrd-files (files go into $dbdir/$domain/)
 <dt>htmldir<dd>Where to png's and htmlfiles end up
 <dt>logdir<dd>Where to send logs
 <dt>rundir<dd>Where to put state files

 <dt>[machine.dom.ain]<dd>Add machine.dom.ain to domain dom.ain. (A short form of [dom.ain;machine.dom.ain].)
</dl>
</tt>

To add a new node, just put in a new section and add the
<tt>address</tt> option.

Domain-level options
<tt>
<dl>
 <dt>node_order<dd>Changes order of nodes in a domain. (Default is alphabetically sorted.)
</dl>
</tt>

Node-level options
<tt>
<dl>
 <dt>address<dd>Set the node address
 <dt>port<dd>Set node port number (default 4949)
 <dt>use_node_name<dd>Set to "yes" or "y" to force getting all the
 default plugins from a node. Good for hosts which changes hostname
 (e.g. laptops).
 <dt>use_default_name<dd>Set to "yes" or "y" to force getting all the
 default plugins from a node. Good for hosts which changes hostname
 (e.g. laptops). NOTE: Deprecated. Use use_node_name instaed.
</dl>
</tt>

Field-level options
<tt>
<dl>
 <dt>sum<dd>Summarise other fields. See the FAQ for how to use this.
 <dt>stack<dd>Stack other fields. See the FAQ for how to use this.
 <dt>+++<dd>Check the node configuration (further up) for everything else.
</dl>
</tt>

<h3>munin-update</h3>
Munin-update reads /etc/munin/munin.conf, searches for nodes,
and connect to the munin-nodes using the address-field. When connected
it will run the list-command to fetch available scripts, then it will
run config for each script. This configuration will expand in the
/etc/munin/munin.conf-file and rdd-databases will be created.
Already expanded configuration will be skipped. Then munin-update runs
through it's newly modified configuration file and runs <tt>fetch</tt> on all
scripts.
<h3>munin-graph</h3>
Munin-graph reads /etc/munin/munin.conf and graphs all services
unless <tt>[service].graph no</tt>. The following options are available
in the configuration
<dl>
limited to 19 characters
<dt>[service].graph_title<dd>The title of the graph
<dt>[service].graph_order<dd>Which order to graph the lines.
<dt>[service].graph_args<dd>Extra arguments to the graph
<dt>[field].label<dd>REQUIRED, the name of the value to be graphed,
<dt>[field].type<dd>Type of value. COUNTER, GAUGE, defaults to GAUGE.
NOTE: When GAUGE is used, only "snapshots" of every 5 minutes are
recorded. Peaks in-between updates will not be graphed. When you use
COUNTER, the numbers are averaged out over the past 5 minutes, so short
peaks will show up as substancially lower than they were.
</dl>
<h3>munin-html</h3>
Munin-html creates the html-pages for the graphs.<br>
Usefull configuration in the server.conf file is:
<dt>node_order [node1] [node2] .... <dd>In which order the nodes
    should be listed, defaults to sorted. This is a domain-level
	option.
<dt>domain_order [domain1] [domain2] .... <dd>In which order the domains
    should be listed, defaults to sorted. This is a top-level option.
<h3>munin-nagios</h3>
Munin-nagios is a optional script to send a passive alert to a
nagios-server. For this to work, you need a nagios-nsca server,
a working send_nsca configuration and the following configuration in
/etc/munin/munin.conf:
<pre>
nsca          /usr/bin/send_nsca
nsca_config   /etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfg
nsca_server   [nsca-server] 
</pre>
Then add .warning and .critical fields in your configuration or
directly into you plugin scripts.
The value for these field can be a single maxvalue or a colonseperated
range 
<pre>
processes.warning 10:300
processes.critical 5:500
</pre>
A value lower than 10 or higher then 300 will result in a warning to
nagios, a value lower than 5 or higher than 500 will result in a
critical to nagios
<p>
Other usefull ranges:
<pre>
[service].warning :400
</pre>
is equal to:
<pre>
[service].warning 400
</pre>
Only warn if lower than 300:
<pre>
[service].warning 300:
</pre>

When a service contains .critical or .warning it will chech it's status
agains the last fetched value. If it's ok, a "{service}.ok" file will be created
in the $dbdir/$domain directory. If the value is not ok. This file will
be removed and munin-nagios will update nagios every 5 minutes untill the
value is ok and a new ".ok" file will be created.
