LRRD consists of two parts - a client and a server. The client runs on 
each of the machines you want to collect data from. The server does the
collecting, and draws the graphs.

To install the server:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the user "lrrd"
	- make install-server
	- create a cron-entry to run "lrrd-cron" as the user "lrrd" every 5
	  minutes

To install the documentation:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- make install-doc

To install the client:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the group "lrrd"
	- make install-client install-client-plugins
	- decide which plugins to use (quick auto-solution: 
	  "lrrd-client-configure --shell | sh")
	- start the client (you probably want an init-script for this)

Notes about client plugins
-------------------------

"make install-client-plugins" installs the plugins in LIBDIR (defined in
Makefile.config). Put the ones you want to use (or better yet, create
softlinks) in CONFDIR/client.d/ . An easy way to do this, is the program
"lrrd-client-configure", using the parameter "--shell". It will then
suggest commands to do this.

Some of the plugins require some configuration to get running. An
example configuration file is found in the file "plugins.conf";

Many OSes and releases thereof have different ways of gathering data. A
lot of OSes still have none (due to us not having access to one). If you
create plugins for a system which is not already in the package, please
send us a copy of them, so we can add them for others to use. We'd also
be happy if you sent us any new plugins on systems already in the
package.
