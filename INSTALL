Munin consists of the main programs, and a node. The node runs on each of
the machines you want to collect data from. The main programs does the
collecting, draws the graphs, and creates the HTML pages. 

To install the main programs:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the user "munin"
	- make install-main
	- create a cron-entry to run "munin-cron" as the user "munin" every 5
	  minutes

To install the documentation:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- make install-doc

To install the client:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the group "munin"
	- make install-node install-node-plugins
	- decide which plugins to use (quick auto-solution: 
	  "munin-node-configure --shell | sh")
	- start the client (you probably want an init-script for this)

Notes about node plugins
--------------------------

"make install-node-plugins" installs the plugins in LIBDIR (defined in
Makefile.config). Put the ones you want to use (or better yet, create
softlinks) in CONFDIR/client.d/ . An easy way to do this, is the program
"munin-node-configure", using the parameter "--shell". It will then
suggest commands to do this.

Some of the plugins require some configuration to get running. An
example configuration file is found in the file "plugins.conf";

Many OSes and releases thereof have different ways of gathering data. A
lot of OSes still have none. If you create plugins for a system which is
not already in the package, please send us a copy of them, so we can add
them for others to use. We'd also be happy if you sent us any new plugins
on systems already in the package.
