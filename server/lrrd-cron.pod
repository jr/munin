=head1 DESCRIPTION

LRRD-cron is a part of the package LRRD-server, which is used in combination with LRRD-client.
LRRD-server is a group of programs to gather data from LRRD-clients, graph them, create html-pages,
and optionally warn Nagios about any off-limit values.

LRRD-cron batches all the above tasks by running their respective programs. All parameters are passed
directly to the underlying programs, so only use parameters that are understood by all the other programs.

=head1 VERSION

This is lrrd-cron version 0.9.2-3
