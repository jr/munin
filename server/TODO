- Munin can warn via nagios (using nsca). This could (and should) be
  generalized so it could warn with arbitrary programs and parameters
  (e.g. send a mail). 
- Create RPM package 
- munin-update: tune the .rrd-file when min and max are changed.
- munin-html show latest value in overviews
- munin-html mark services over warning and critical 
- munin-update serveral degrees of detail in the .rrd-files. Choose
  which when creating the file. E.g. option: RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:115200
  (keep every 5 minutes for 400 days == around 900k per data source).
- munin-nagios Only send 20 OK messages to nagios each time it's run.
  Never more.
