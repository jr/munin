This is a pre-release checklist for the maintainer.

 * Does make node-monkeywrench run without abnormal abortions?
 * Is .htaccess installed?
 * rm -f /etc/munin/plugins/* 
      Does munin-node-configure -d show any autoconf errors?

 * Update node/plugins.history.in:

   Figure out which r the previous tag was at and do this (r910 was
	1.3.2 and r1234 is head)
   svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A |
	cut -c 25- | cut -d. -f1 | sort -u

 * Check if the listed plugins are still present (or moved):

   svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A |
        cut -c 18- | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs ls -ld
