# REQUIREMENTS: in your named.conf you must have statistics-interval set:
# options {
#    ...
#    statistics-interval 1;
#    ...
# };
# The number is in minutes.  At each interval just 3 lines is dumped.
# It can be desturbing if you usually read the logs yourself, but
# a 1 minute interval ensures very updated information to munin.
# 5 minutes is the maximum I'd say.

# The name of the file where syslog puts daemon output - ie the named
# statistics output.  On solaris this is /var/adm/messages, on most
# linuxes it is /var/log/messages.  But on Debian it is
# /var/log/daemon which is read restricted so we have to run as a user
# with read rights, or remove the restrictions.
