# janl_: can I in a shell script save STDOUT so I can restore it after
#        a "exec >>somefile"?
# james: exec 2>&4 etc.
# janl_: this saves handle 2 in handle 4?
# james: yes, that's basically the same as dup
# james: dup2, even
# janl_: so... ... "exec 4>&2" to restore?
# james: Actually you can do: exec 4>&2- ... which closes 4 afterwards ...
#        I think that's historical behaviour and not a newish extension
