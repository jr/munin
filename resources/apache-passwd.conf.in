# If the .htaccess file does not work you will need something like the
# following:

<Directory /@@HTMLDIR@@>
	AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
</Directory>

# If you don't like .htaccess files (they have some overhead compared
# to the apache config files include the contents of the .htaccess
# file in the above stanza instead of the AllowOverride statement.
