      - Run the postfix_mailqueue plugin as the postfix user only if it exists.

 -- Tore Anderson <tore@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Mar 2005 13:55:36 +0100

munin (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
      - Plugin linux/irqstats now handles blank lines in /proc/interrupts,
        closes: #296452.
      - Plugins generic/apache_* could in some cases cause spurious spikes,
        this has now been fixed.  Closes: #296454, #296645.
      - Plugin linux/df_inode now handles devices with hyphens in their names
        correctly, closes: #298442.
      - Plugin generic/exim_mailstats now graphs rejects, closes: #295799.
      - Earlier versions of munin-update could in some cases complain about
        "nested quantifiers in regex", now fixed.  Closes: #296575.
      - Fixes some broken HTML in the templates, closes: #296676.
      - Updates over very slow connections are now handled more gracefully,
        closes: #298108.

  * debian/rules, debian/plugins.conf, debian/NEWS:
      - Do not include contrib plugins in the munin-node package anymore.
        Sort-of closes: #296533, #297451, #297628, #297904, #298895.

  * debian/rules, debian/munin-node.postinst:
      - Delay startup of the node significantly, as it may require other
        monitored services (e.g. ntpd) to be already running.  Also change the
        startup time if the package is being upgraded, if the current init
        configuration is the old package's defaults.  Closes: #298793, thanks
        to Stephen Gran for noticing.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Run the Courier-MTA and Postfix plugins with necessary additional
        privileges so they work out of the box, closes: #297654, #296985.
        Thanks to Charles Fry and Juraj Bednar for pointing this out.
      - The smart_ plugin is now run as root (which is necessary).

  * debian/control:
      - Suggest acpi over lm-sensors, and not the other way around as it was
        earlier.  Both the acpi and sensors_ plugins achieve the same thing,
        but the former is auto while the latter is manual.
      - Remove the hddtemp suggestion and replace it with smartmontools,
        closes: #296361. The hddtemp* plugins was replaced with
        hddtemp_smartctl in 1.2.0.
      - Suggest python (>= 2.2), used by the smart_ plugin.
      - A few minor rewrites in the descriptions.

  * debian/munin-node.manpages:
      - Include munin-node-configure-snmp(8).

  * server/munin-limits.in:
      - Reverted to upstream version, as the patched required in 1.2.0-1 have
        been merged.

munin (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #264878, #293499, #290099:
      - Many plugins have changed type from COUNTER to DERIVE, to avoid
        spurious spikes when the counters are mistakenly assumed to have
        wrapped.  This change may cause empty graphs to occur, take care to
        read NEWS.Debian before upgrading the "munin-node" package!
        Closes: #225623, #233762.
      - Munin-update no longer truncates long field names, closes: #256370.
        This may in some cases cause empty graphs, please read NEWS.Debian for
        more information before upgrading the "munin" package.
      - Replaces the old Nagios-specific integration with a much more generic
        framework for sending alerts to wherever you want.  As a side effect,
        this closes: #291168.
      - Corrects an erroneous commented example in munin.conf, closes: #294060.
      - The munin-node.conf setting default_plugin_user now actually works as
        advertised, closes: #295366, #295367.
      - Plugin generic/bind9 now source its configuration from %ENV,
        closes: #268142, #272049.
      - Plugin generic/amavis now autodetects how to correctly invoke logtail,
        closes: #284638, #288395.
      - Plugin generic/squid_cache now correctly calculates cache size when
        using multiple cache directories, closes: #288579.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now defaults to reading from a more
        correct log file, closes: #291720.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now correctly identifies the reject
        code as newer Postfix versions logs them, closes: #292110.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailvolume now has a improved graph_title (that
        is not the same as the title of generic/postfix_mailstats).
        Closes: #292083.
      - Plugin generic/named now defaults to reading from a more correct log
        file, closes: #291849.
      - Plugin linux/fw_forwarded_local now correctly reports 0 instead of
        NaN in some situations, closes: #284673.
      - Plugin linux/iostat now ingores devices that have had no I/O operations
        whatsoever and thus are assumed to be unused, closes: #267195.
      - New plugin: linux/forks. Closes: #225638.
      - New plugin: linux/uptime. Closes: #283622.
      - New plugin: linux/irqstats. Closes: #224990.
      - New plugin: generic/courier_. Closes: #291854.
      - New plugin: generic/perdition. Closes: #291855.

  * debian/NEWS:
      - Document the changes that may lead to data loss when upgrading from
        Munin 1.0.x, and also write a bit about the new munin-limits framework.

  * debian/control:
      - Add dependency on perl-modules (>= 5.8.0) | libparse-recdescent-perl
        for the main munin package, as munin-limits requires Text::Balanced.
      - Add libdate-manip-perl as a recommended package for the munin package,
        as the new CGI functionality depends on it.
      - Change libnet-snmp-perl to be a recommended package for munin-node
        instead of only suggested, as the new munin-node-configure-snmp
        requires it.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Install the new CGI in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, as mandated by the Debian
        Policy Manual.

  * debian/munin.cron.d, debian/munin.manpages, debian/munin.logrotate,
    debian/munin.postrm:
      - The new upstream release includes "munin-limits", which supersede
        "munin-nagios".  Update the installed manual pages, cron jobs,
        logrotate configuration, and purge script accordingly.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Plugin linux/fw_conntrack is now run as root as this file recently has
        changed to not be world readable, closes: #291226.
      - Plugin linux/if_ is now run as root in order to probe the speed of the
        network interface.

  * debian/munin.postinst, debian/munin-node.postinst, debian/munin.postrm,
    debian/munin-node.postrm:
      - Use dpkg-statoverride to handle the permissions on the data and log
        directories.

  * server/munin-limits.in:
      - Change lock file directory to match that of munin-update, munin-graph,
        and munin-html (grabbed from upstream CVS).
      - Fix a string comparsions where the "==" operator was used instead of
        "eq" (grabbed from upstream CVS).

  * debian/munin.postinst:
      - Only change user and group ownership on the data files from "lrrd" to
        "munin" when the package is first installed, not on every upgrade.

munin (0+1.0.0pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #231049:
      - Project renamed from "LRRD" to "Munin".  Almost every file in the

      - Allows for customizing which port to connect to when the server is

        sort-of closes: #214277.
      - Relaxes the paranoia regarding the plugins' ownership and permission
        modes somewhat, closes: #214186, #216401.
      - Further impovements to the error-handling logic in lrrd-server, which
        hopefully closes: #215739, #222674, #222821.
      - Removed the spurious use of Config::General in lrrd-client,
        closes: #216176.

        configuration file format is now deprecated.
      - Change priority to extra, due to the dependency on librrds-perl.

  * debian/rules:
      - Polished slightly.

  * debian/lrrd-client.dirs:
      - Removed unecessary entry /var/run/lrrd, which is installed from the
        Makefile.

  * debian/lrrd-client.init:
      - Rewritten, now sports improved error handling and intrinsic distrust of
        start-stop-daemon's return values, closes: #202190.

  * debian/lrrd-server.cron.d:
      - Check if the binaries we're about to run exist and are executable
        before running them, closes: #221691.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - If we're updating from the packages which didn't create the lrrd system
        group, try to make the GID the same as the already existing lrrd users'
        UID, if it's available.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
      - Rewritten as a shell script.
      - Initial plugin setup now relies on lrrd-client-configure instead of an
        internal function to to initialize plugins.  This also ensures that
        automatic plugins later added to the package will be enabled on
        upgrades.
      - The plugins' state files was inappropriately placed in /var/run, move
        them to /var/lib if any exist in the former location.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - Actually check how we're called, don't blindly assume we're
        configuring.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm, debian/lrrd-client.postrm:
      - Better handling of empty dirs after purge.  (This is workaround for
        dpkg bug #198522).

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm:
      - Remove some ucf stuff I had forgotten about.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Updated to the new syntax for passing options to the plugins.

      - Now only contains overrides to the upstream defaults, instead of being
        a full replacement for upstream's Makefile.config.
      - PLUGSTATE changed from /var/run/lrrd to /var/lib/lrrd/plugin-state, as
        these files should persist after reboots.

      setting 'use_default_name'.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Add the system group lrrd as well as a system user, and ensure that all
      data directories are owned and writeble by these.
  * debian/plugins.conf (new):
    - Includes configuration settings for the plugins.
  * debian/lrrd-client.docs (new), debian/lrrd-server.docs (new):

    to ensure the hostname matches the client's, closes: #203960.
  * Do not determine the hostname and domain during build.

lrrd (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Massive changes in build system, update debian/rules accordingly.
    - The server will now ignore unreachable nodes, and should thus not
      send root arcane error messages anymore, closes: #200487.
  * After reading through the texmf.cnf thread on debian-devel, I realize
    I've forgotten the simplizity and no-nonsense qulities about Debian
    that attracted me in the first place, and that I've fallen for the
    temptation of making the configuration scripts too pretentious and
    loquacious. Therefore, I've killed all of the Debconf questions, and
    instead enable a default set of plugins based on the autoconf and
    suggests routines, closes: #197413.
  * /etc/lrrd/client.conf is now a conffile handled by dpkg.
  * Rewrote lrrd-client's postinst in Perl.
  * Include the APT plugin in the lrrd-client package.  Hence, the
    lrrd-client package now Conflicts and Replaces lrrd-plugin-apt.
    Thanks to James Troup for the suggestion.
  * Declare the debhelper compat level in debian/compat instead of in
    debian/rules.
  * Standards-Version 3.6.0, no changes required.
