Description: Linpro's network-wide graphing framework (client)
 LRRD is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains the `client'. You should install it on all the nodes
 in your network. It will know how to extract all sorts of data from the
 node it runs on, and will wait for the `server' to request this data for
 further processing.
 .
 It includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as
 cpu usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins
 which are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy,
 and is often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which
 relay information from other devices in your network that can't run LRRD,
 such as a switch or a server running another operating system, by using
 SNMP or similar technology.
 .
 LRRD is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
 RRDtool. To see a real example of LRRD in action, take a peek at

Description: Linpro's network-wide graphing framework (server)
 LRRD is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains the `server'. You will only need one instance of it
 in your network. It will periodically poll all the `clients' in your network
 it's aware of for data, which it in turn will use to create graphs and HTML
 pages, suitable for viewing with your graphical web browser of choice.
 .
 It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset boundary,
 useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for
 instance. Currently you can only do this by letting LRRD send messages to
 a Nagios server.
