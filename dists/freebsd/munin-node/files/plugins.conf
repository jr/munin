#
# This file contains configuration options for the plugins. Three
# options are understood by munin-node itself:
#
# 	user <user>         # Set the user to run the plugin as
# 	group <group>       # Set the group to run the plugin as
# 	command <command>   # Run <command> instead of the plugin. %c
# 	                      expands to what would normally be run.
#   env.<variable>      # Sets <variable> in the plugin's environment, see the
#                         individual plugins to find out which variables they
#                         care about.
